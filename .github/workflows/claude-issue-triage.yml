            Context:
            - This is a Textbringer plugin for Tree-sitter syntax highlighting
            - Issues labeled "upstream-sync" are auto-generated by workflows
            - FAVEOD_VERSION in exe/textbringer-tree-sitter defines the current parser version

            For "upstream-sync" issues:
            1. Check if it's a false positive (already addressed)
            2. If new node types: suggest which ones might need Face mappings
            3. If new parser version: check if we're already using it

            For regular issues:
            1. Acknowledge the issue
            2. Provide initial analysis
            3. Suggest next steps if applicable

            Respond in a concise, helpful manner by posting a comment.
            If the issue is a false positive, recommend closing it.
